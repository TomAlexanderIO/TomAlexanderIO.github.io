[{"content":"Hello world. In an increasingly fast world, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s good to think back to the first small step because that\u0026rsquo;s where it all starts, and from there, you can always move forward.\nI am Tom Alexander Bult√©, an Online Marketing specialist living in Zwolle, the Netherlands. Being practical and willing to try things is who I am. Wanting to do or be able to do things right the first time is also my biggest challenge, which sometimes causes fear of failure.\nI started this personal website to share some of my notes with the world for those who find it interesting and for those who can learn something from it. Topics I want to share with you here are personal stories, travel stories, hobby projects, smart home projects, development projects, and who knows what more. A lot of self-learning projects ‚öôÔ∏è\nMy ideas and elaboration will surely not always be perfect. You may know a better way. No problem and I like to learn from you. Feel free to comment üôèüèª\nThank you.\n","date":"2023-09-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://tomalexander.io/p/hello-world/hello-world_huce17368b629b0ff5954e732d77b74888_456356_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://tomalexander.io/p/hello-world/","title":"MY FIRST POST."}]
