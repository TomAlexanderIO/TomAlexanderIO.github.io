        <description>&lt;img src="https://tomalexander.io/p/hello-world/hello-world.png" alt="Featured image of post MY FIRST POST." /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello world.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly fast world, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s good to think back to the first small step because that&amp;rsquo;s where it all starts, and from there, you can always move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Tom Alexander Bult√©, an Online Marketing specialist living in Zwolle, the Netherlands. Being practical and willing to try things is who I am. Wanting to do or be able to do things right the first time is also my biggest challenge, which sometimes causes fear of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this personal website to share some of my notes with the world for those who find it interesting and for those who can learn something from it. Topics I want to share with you here are personal stories, travel stories, hobby projects, smart home projects, development projects, and who knows what more. A lot of self-learning projects ‚öôÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideas and elaboration will surely not always be perfect. You may know a better way. No problem and I like to learn from you. Feel free to comment üôèüèª&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
